HMA Architecture Working Group

Feasibility cient is built with Google Web Toolkit and OpenLayers.

Based on the OGC standards:
  * OGC 13-032 OpenSearch GeoSpatial and Temporal Extensions
  * OGC 13-026 OpenSearch Extension for Earth Observation Products
  * OGC 13-042 RESTful Encoding Ordering Services for Earth Observation Products
  * OGC 13-043 Download Service for Earth Observation Products
  * OGC 13-039 OpenSearch Extension for Earth Observation Satellite Tasking Implementation

The HMA Projects are overviewed by the HMA Architecture Working Group HMA AWG and the Ground Segment Coordination Body (GSCB). Information about the Heterogeneous Missions Access Architecture Working Group and related meetings is available at the HMA AWG page.

The GSCB was created to ensure that contributions to GMES adopt a common, coordinated and cost-effective approach that responds to the needs of Earth observation users. View the GSCB Report 2009.

Related ESA financed projects The HMA-S project. The SMAAD project deals with the use on ontologies and thesauri related to various HMA and OGC metadata standards and mediation across domains. The O3S project evaluates and demonstrates OGC Web Services, in particular where the WCS brings benefits to satellite EO PDGSs and users. Past HMA Related.
